# JavaScript 2 - MA1

![image]()

This is a simple overview of the use/purpose of the Module Assignment.

## Description

Use only plain JavaScript for this MA.

Use modules (imports and exports) and reusable functions where appropriate.

This is the API endpoint you will use:
```
https://fakestoreapi.com/
```

Connect to the API and display the name and price property of each result.

Display some kind of loading indicator while the API call is in progress.

Add an input that filters the results by maximum price. This can be on the keyup event on the input, or the click event of a button.

For example, if a user enters 50, only results with a price of 50 or less should be displayed.

Display a message if the filter returns no results.

This are some bullet points:

- HTML.
- CSS.
- Sass. 
- Js.
